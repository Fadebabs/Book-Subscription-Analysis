This a review and analysis of a book subscription platform.

Analyzing Customer Behaviour (Using Python and MySQL Database)
Here, I cleaned and processed data from a book subscription platform (livebook) and
prepared it for investigatory analysis to discover customer use patterns. Loaded raw data
of customer behaviour data into an SQL database for analysis, categorized and checked the event
records for bad data, and generated insights that could help us understand various metrics.
